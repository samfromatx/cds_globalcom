            	<h1>CDS Global Celebrates 40 Years of Innovation</h1>
                <p>On April 27, 2012, CDS Global launched a yearlong celebration commemorating 40 years of innovation and reinvention. The celebration kicked off with a global video broadcast. CDS Global teams around the world came together to hear from Chairman and CEO Malcolm Netburn; Don Ross, one of CDS Global’s founding members and a past president; and John Loughlin, executive vice president and general manager of Hearst Magazines.</p>
                <p>Ross shared a humorous yet poignant anecdote from CDS Global’s inception. CDS Global’s first conversion nearly failed to make it to Des Moines in time due to a groundhog chewing through electrical circuits for the landing lights at the Des Moines airport. Luckily, Ross was able to drive the critical tapes to Des Moines and overcome CDS Global’s first challenge.</p>
                <p>Loughlin stressed that CDS Global’s dedicated workforce, with an average tenure of more than 12 years, coupled with strong leadership, have helped the organization remain resilient through periods of change. Netburn built on Loughlin’s remarks, reiterating that not only does CDS Global espouse the values of a trusted institution, but we were founded on a spirit of innovation and adaptation that our workforce continues to model to this day.

                <p>On Sept. 10, 2012, CDS Global celebrated our 40th anniversary with clients on the first night of the CDS Global Summit. <a href="/perspectives/summit.html">Read more about the CDS Global Summit here</a>.</p>
                <p>CDS Global continues to look to the future and ensure our clients are well-equipped for the digital era. We are no stranger to disruption like that we’re seeing today in digital publishing. CDS Global was born of disruption. The company was founded from the ashes of LOOK magazine when a group of employees formed a new company – Downe Computer Services – with the publication’s fulfillment system. </p>
                <p>Disruptive forces, such as the growth of television, that led to <em>LOOK</em>’s demise served as the incubator for the modern CDS Global. The company grew by opening operations facilities throughout the state of Iowa, and in 1982 was purchased by Hearst Corporation. </p>
                <p>We continued to expand, and in 2007, a strategic vision for the private company was launched by then-newly appointed Chairman and CEO Malcolm Netburn. The vision included a focus on matching core competencies with new markets. CDS Global is not immune to the economic challenges that force  companies to make tough decisions, but we have continued on course. CDS Global has grown into a company that not only meets disruptions head-on, but makes the disruptive climate a part of our business model. </p>
                <p>In 2011, in the midst of persistent global economic uncertainty, CDS Global acquired an Iowa-based electronic payments company. This tactical move brings innovative technology and industry expertise to CDS Global that allows the organization to provide both paper-based and electronic payment processing and document presentment for clients in a single solution.</p>
                <p>Last year, CDS Global managed 200 million inbound transactions, 535 million consumer-targeted promotions and 10.5 million inbound calls for our clients while processing 15 million monthly remittance payments and depositing nearly $7 billion on behalf of our clients. While the majority of these transactions took place in the U.S., a growing percentage occurred in Canada, the U.K. and Australia – three key international markets into which CDS Global has expanded. By replicating our corporate values and business model to multiple locations around the world, the organization has been able to remain local while keeping pace in a global economy – and leads the market on each of the continents in which we operate. </p>
                <p>In the digital revolution, the company is accelerating our proactive approach to innovation and technology development. CDS Global is aligning and integrating our systems with digital platforms produced by the likes of Adobe, Amazon and Apple in order to place our clients in a position to capitalize on disruption themselves – seamlessly transitioning from print and paper to digital content and electronic delivery. </p>
                <p>As CDS Global enters our fourth decade of business, we are testing our mettle and identifying what has made the company successful throughout our history. While not exempt from challenges and disruptions, we have remained profitable since our first year in business, continually assessing its business practices for sustainable growth. </p>
