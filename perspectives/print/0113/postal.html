              <h2>Intelligent  Mail Barcode (IMb)</h2>
                <p>              Also on Jan. 27, the USPS will no longer  recognize the POSTNET barcode as a means for mailers to obtain automation  discounts for letters, cards, flats and periodicals. Only an IMb will meet the  requirements for automation postage. Either the basic or full-service IMb will  satisfy this rule change. Qualified Business Reply Mail (QBRM) must contain an  IMb to receive discounted postage.  </p>
                <p>The  use of IMb gives mailers the ability to receive additional postage discounts,  obtain Address Change Service (ACS) at no charge and increase mail visibility  to track the delivery of mail. </p>
                <p>Failure  to print an IMb after the effective date will cause an increase in postage of  up to 23 percent as compared to current automation rates. QBRM postage will  increase by as much as $.10 per piece without an IMb.</p>
                <p>CDS  Global has been helping our clients navigate IMb since the beginning. We were the  very first in the industry to assist mailers in becoming fully compliant and  approved by the USPS, and were one of the first organizations to partner with  the Postal Service to help our clients with the IMb on-boarding process. Today,  CDS Global continues to support our clients in making the IMb transition. To  learn more or for assistance with your IMb transition, please contact your  client director.                </p>
                <h2>No  Additional Entry Fee for Periodicals</h2>
                <p>Periodical  mailers are no longer required to pay a fee for additional entry locations.  Approved periodicals may now mail from any post office. Mailers can  apply for free at a new post office for that office to be an additional entry  location, whereas before mailers had to make that request at their original  post office.                </p>
                <h2>Change  in Advertising Percentage</h2>
                <p>Periodical  Requester publications will now be permitted to exceed the 75 percent advertising  limitation on no more than 25 percent of the issues produced in any 12-month  period. This change will allow publishers greater advertising flexibility  during periods of high advertising volume.</p>
                <h2>New  Option for Periodical Identification Statement</h2>
                <p>The  USPS is offering publishers the option to direct Undeliverable As Addressed  (UAA) mail to a Centralized Forwarding Site (CFS) rather than directly from the  local delivery unit. The goals are to increase the number of electronic Address  Correction System (ACS) notifications and lower the volume of hard-copy  returns.</p>
                <p><strong>CURRENT</strong><br>
                  POSTMASTER:  Send address changes to {Publication Title and Mailing Address}. </p>
                <p><strong>NEW</strong><br>
                  POSTMASTER:  Send all UAA mail to CFS. <br>
                  NON-POSTAL AND MILITARY FACILITIES: Send address corrections to {Publication  Title and Mailing Address}.</p>
                <p>CDS Global encourages the use of this new statement. Adoption should  lower ACS costs and expedite the application of customer service transactions related  to subscriber change of address information and Undeliverable As Addressed  mail.</p>
