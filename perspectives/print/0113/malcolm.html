                <p>Technology is like oxygen. It’s everywhere, touching everything we do, impacting how we work, powering our products, customers and commerce. From global giants like Apple, Intel and IBM to garage and basement startups; from computers that fill warehouses powering flights to Mars to the ephemeral cloud where more and more of our individual data is mysteriously stored. Technology is like oxygen – the life force that every cell needs to exist and thrive.</p>
                <p>Our business is no different. All of our clients across a variety of industries – utilities, nonprofits, consumer products and media – are impacted by technology. Whether you are reinforcing your brand or deepening your relationship with your customer, donor or subscriber, technology sits square in the middle. And anytime you are asking for a payment or donation, technology now drives that interaction. </p>
                <p>CDS Global has been building on its legacy of technology innovation. But the pace of change requires us to quicken our step and be more nimble, adaptive and responsive to change. And not just with words, but with new products that we can bring more speedily to market. We must lead rather than follow.</p>
                <p>That’s why we are so excited about our digital order management system, eHub. We call it eHub because it sits right square in the middle of the new economy. As the hub of the digital transaction, it allows for interacting with your customers seamlessly in their digital relationship with you. It’s your future, and it’s our future, too.</p>
                <p>While technology certainly drives so much of what we do, it’s still people that make for a great company and for great products and services. It always has and always will be. People invent great technologies and drive great innovation, and eHub has been built by an incredible team that makes incredible products. </p>
                <p>At CDS Global we believe in creating exceptional customer experiences for you and, more importantly, for the consumers who buy your products and services, or who support your work and effort. Technology allows us to do just that, and our new digital products help deliver on our promise of shattering your expectations.</p>
