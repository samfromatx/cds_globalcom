            	<h1>eHub: Your Digital Entitlement Engine</h1>
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <p>In early 2012, CDS Global launched eHub, our online subscription billing and entitlement management platform that allows companies to build, run and operate subscription and recurring revenue businesses. With eHub, CDS Global is meeting the demands of the digital marketplace. No longer do consumers want to be tied to their print magazine on an issue-by-issue basis; they want access to digital assets from any device at any time. But eHub is for more than just publishers &ndash; its capabilities can help customers connect with companies across industries. eHub is available to any business that requires time-based subscription services or recurring payment options to serve their evolving customer needs. </p>
                <h2>How eHub can Monetize Digital Offerings</h2>
              <p>eHub has the power to monetize a wide range of digital assets &ndash; anything from daily news and special features to crafts, patterns or floor plans &ndash; with a platform that offers automatic recurring entitlement to consumers.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom:0px;padding-bottom:0px;"> Examples include:</p>
                <ul style="margin-bottom:-5px;line-height: 1.5em;">

                  <li><strong>Integration</strong>:  A robust set of <a href="http://www.cds-global.com/media/pdf/datasheet_web_service_gateway.pdf" target="_blank">Application  Programming Interfaces (APIs)</a> enables  organizations to connect with external entitlement and order channels.</li>
                  <li><strong>Packaged  Digital Assets</strong>: eHub features the ability to package two or more&nbsp;digital asset  products and offer them for one price instead of charging the customer for each  product individually (available in early 2013). </li>
                  <li><strong>eTificates</strong>:  eHub allows customers to gift specific products to a recipient (available in early 2013).</li>
