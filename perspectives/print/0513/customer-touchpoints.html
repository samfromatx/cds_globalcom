            	<h1>CDS Global Customer Touchpoints: More than Just Service-level Agreements</h1>
            	<p>Organizations across industries use CDS Global&rsquo;s customer service for many concrete reasons, such as our breadth of services and nearly 60 percent share of the North American fulfillment market. They also realize consumers&rsquo; increasingly high expectations &ndash; &ldquo;Amazon and Zappos have taught them to demand more, so we can&rsquo;t have customer care that&rsquo;s not up to the standards they are used to,” says Laura Zandi, senior vice president of circulation at M. Shanken Communications. </p>
                <p>But perhaps what sets CDS Global apart is the expansive expertise, knowledge of the publishing industry, ability to deliver on changing needs, leading-edge solutions and peace of mind we provide. Read on to learn why companies come to &ndash; and stay with &ndash; CDS Global for all their customer service needs. </p>
              	<h2>We Know that Customer Service is Crucial to Your Business</h2>
       	  	  <p>CDS Global recognizes that our clients are experts in their own rights. Turning customer service over to CDS Global enables organizations to focus on what they do best. &ldquo;Our customers make all the difference. They are who we cater to, but our expertise is not customer support,” says Michael Thomas, senior digital product manager for Scientific American. &ldquo;Customer support is a real genuine business with a real set of skills you have to hire for, and CDS Global is a leader in that realm.”</p>
                <p>We also know that satisfied customers ensure your success. &ldquo;Without our customers, we would not be who we are today,” says Silvia Rider, vice president of consumer marketing for Hoffman Media, who recently turned to CDS Global&rsquo;s Web Store solution and its accompanying customer service. &ldquo;In-house, we didn&rsquo;t have the staff or space to answer the phone calls in a timely manner, and there&rsquo;s probably nothing more frustrating than when a customer wants to order something and they have to wait,” she says. &ldquo;CDS Global was much better equipped to handle the volume of calls. It&rsquo;s given us peace of mind.”</p>
                <h2>We Serve as an Extension of Your Brand</h2>
              <p>When Hoffman Media considered outsourcing its customer service, they understandably felt that no one could take better care of their customers than themselves. But when they experienced first-hand how CDS Global seamlessly blends with their brand, they felt comfortable transitioning from their in-house operations. &ldquo;For us, it was very important that the customer not know the difference. We don&rsquo;t want them to know that they aren&rsquo;t calling Hoffman Media,” says Rider.</p>
                <p>CDS Global realizes the power of promoting brands through our actions, and that our interactions with customers can have a strong impact on your business. To ensure every touchpoint is successful, our customer service representative training program embeds trainees in the call center process, investing them in your goals and strategies until they become full-fledged brand ambassadors. Once they are on the phone, representatives have access to askCDSGlobal, our information platform that helps them become more knowledgeable about your brand and products. It provides representatives with the information they need to communicate effectively with callers, from upcoming events to known delays in shipments to images of recent magazine covers. </p>
                <h2>We Streamline Your Outsourced Services</h2>
                <p>CDS Global&rsquo;s full suite of solutions allows companies to house all of their customer touchpoints under one provider, eliminating customer confusion and the need for multiple phone calls. Zandi says that CDS Global prevents M. Shanken&rsquo;s subscribers from getting caught in an &ldquo;endless loop of bad information” as they struggle to find the correct point of contact. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bad message,” she says. &ldquo;You have a customer that you spent a lot of money to obtain, and bad customer service gives you a chance of losing them. We have many different products that can raise many different questions, and we don&rsquo;t want to send customers all over the map in order to get what they need done.”</p>
                <p>Until recently Hoffman Media, who employs CDS Global&rsquo;s magazine customer service, managed its Web Store customer service in-house. Rider explains the confusion this caused: &ldquo;A customer would call CDS Global to order a book on our Web Store, but of course CDS Global didn&rsquo;t know that we were offering a book or didn&rsquo;t have the book, so the customer had to call two different places.” When they brought their Web Store customer service to CDS Global, the synergy completely eliminated this friction point: &ldquo;Now a customer can call, order a book and check on their subscription because everything is housed in one division. No one ever has to say, &lsquo;Sorry, you need to call a different number.&rsquo;”</p>
                <h2>We Help Navigate Burgeoning Technology</h2>
              <p>CDS Global ensures that using customer service platforms is easy and instinctive, especially with online care pages. &ldquo;We want customers to feel comfortable with the process,” says Zandi. &ldquo;We want customer care pages to work for someone who&rsquo;s not that comfortable working on their computer and doesn&rsquo;t do a lot of eCommerce. It should be something that comes naturally.”</p>
                <p>In recent months, CDS Global has worked with M. Shanken to build a site that meets customers&rsquo; ever-increasing demands. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a much cleaner site,” Zandi says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s user-friendly and more intuitive.”</p>
              <h2>We Drive Revenue</h2>
                <p>The economies of scale that CDS Global provides help our clients reduce costs on every customer touchpoint. But our personalized, <a href="/solutions/product_fulfillment/customer_service.html" target="_blank">intelligent up-sells and cross-sells</a> combine cost savings and revenue generation to boost clients&rsquo; bottom lines. Companies can personalize offers while maximizing the conversation with the customer by obtaining valuable information such as an email address. Angie Nash, senior manager of customer service for CDS Global, notes that customers are becoming increasingly comfortable with receiving offers. &ldquo;Because you see up-selling everywhere, whether it&rsquo;s a fast food place, a clothing store or the movie theater, people are more accepting of listening to the offer and oftentimes agreeing to it.”</p>
                <p>Publishers like M. Shanken are also taking advantage of CDS Global&rsquo;s Web-based up-sells and cross-sells. &ldquo;We look at it as a puzzle, so every page that a user visits says something like, &lsquo;Would you like to renew now?&rsquo; or &lsquo;Would you like to purchase Wine Spectator because you&rsquo;re a Whisky Advocate subscriber?&rsquo; There&rsquo;s not many times a consumer gets to a page that we don&rsquo;t have an offer for something else,” says Zandi.</p>
                <h2>We Provide Unparalleled Customer Care</h2>
                <p>As consumers grow increasingly frustrated by ineffective offshore customer service, companies are bucking the trend and &ldquo;<a href="http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21569572-after-decades-sending-work-across-world-companies-are-rethinking-their-offshoring" target="_blank">reshoring</a>,” or bringing their customer service back to their home country. For these &ldquo;reshorers,” what may have started as a money-saving measure ends up costing more in lost revenue opportunities. New clients are increasingly turning to CDS Global, who for more than 40 years has been providing service that replicates our clients&rsquo; care for their customers, from the Midwestern friendliness of <a href="/perspectives/2013/may/interview-highlights-meredith.html">Meredith Corporation</a> to the Southern hospitality of Hoffman Media.</p>
                <p>Rider describes how Hoffman Media relies on CDS Global&rsquo;s quality customer service to attract and cultivate subscribers: &ldquo;If a customer has a pleasant experience, whether it is calling and renewing or buying a product, they are more likely to call again or even buy another product. Every customer is treated with courtesy and professionalism. They feel good, they feel heard, they know their problem is being taken care of, and they are treated with respect.”</p>
