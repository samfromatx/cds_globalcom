            	<h1>Ensuring Excellent Customer Service: Q-and-A with Highlights&rsquo; Jeff Cundiff and Meredith&rsquo;s Renee Gilley-Gates</h1>
                <p><strong>Q: Why is customer service so integral to your business?</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Jeff Cundiff, director of consumer call centers at Highlights for Children:</strong> While Highlights provides a great list of products that are second to none, service differentiates us from others. Service is a means to make a difference in the lives of our customers, to spend a moment with them on the most basic of human interactions &ndash; communicating one-on-one &ndash; with service being the lifeblood of our organization.</p>
                <p>We have to effectively serve the customer to understand what they like or dislike about our brand as a whole and to improve our products and the customer experience, which in turn allows them to become brand advocates while we constantly move forward, evolving with their needs and our mission.</p>
                <p><strong>Renee Gilley-Gates, customer service manager for consumer marketing at Meredith Corporation:</strong> Excellent customer service is of the highest importance to survive in today&rsquo;s environment. If a customer has a great customer service experience versus a bad one, we will continue to keep them with us versus losing them to someone else. It&rsquo;s as simple as if we don&rsquo;t care, how can we expect our customers to care? I hear a lot from customers who are thrilled to have the opportunity to talk with a live person and they are even more thrilled to learn they are from the Midwest. We wouldn&rsquo;t be in business without our customers &ndash; they are our greatest assets.</p>
                <p><strong>Q: What trends are you noticing in customer service?</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Jeff:</strong>  Customers are busier than ever. The way they interact with us is changing; contact methods are changing. Customers want to contact us on their terms. That may mean via phone, but more likely by some other method, such as Web-based, email, live chat or even text. We have to focus on being available to engage with them through the channels that make sense to our business and for the customer. </p>
                <p>Another trend is that customers are expecting bad service more than ever. This puts us in a great spot to offer exceptional service and stand out in the crowd.</p>
                <p><strong>Renee:</strong> I think we are all seeing our magazine business changing, specifically with digital technologies.  You have to be able to adapt to change or you will be left behind. So, a strong customer service culture that is willing to embrace these new challenges with your business is only going to enhance the customer experience.  </p>
                <p><strong>Q: Explain your customer experience philosophy. </strong></p>
                <p><strong>Jeff:</strong> My philosophy is to engage with the customer where they are, to be human, to understand their needs and provide an experience that leaves them raving about Highlights for Children as a world-class provider of not just a product but a lifestyle, rooted in helping children become their best selves.  </p>
                <p><strong>Renee:</strong> I have a quote that I refer to frequently that sums up how I view the customer experience.  &ldquo;There is only one boss. The customer! And she/he can fire everyone in the company from the chairman down, simply by spending their money somewhere else. So the bottom line is, if we do not treat every customer with equal respect, they can leave in a heartbeat.  </p>
                <p><strong>Q: What do you value about the CDS Global customer service team?</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Jeff:</strong> I value their passion to partner with my team. I appreciate them embracing our mission, goals and our quest to serve children. The most valuable aspect of entrusting CDS Global with our customer care is that our customers believe they are talking to Highlights for Children. To us, a call handled by a CDS Global representative sounds like a call handled by our internal contact center. The same level of care, empathy and concern is emulated whether handled in-house or in CDS Global&rsquo;s Des Moines facility. To me that is a huge value, rarely duplicated by other third-party providers I have worked with. It&rsquo;s a testament to the fact that the team at CDS Global is not just a partner but a member of the Highlights family &ndash; and how can you value anything more than that?</p>
                <p><strong>Renee:</strong> I value the customer service team&rsquo;s willingness to take on any challenge and run with it. With digital in the mix, I feel the customer service group has stepped up to learn the ins and outs on new devices so that they can clearly help our customers log in and access their subscriptions. This is just one example of their enthusiasm to learn what is needed to keep it business as usual.</p>
                <p><strong>Q: How does CDS Global best serve as an extension of your brand?</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Jeff:</strong> Many customers have their first experience with Highlights for Children through an interaction with the contact center. It&rsquo;s that first interaction that introduces them to the Highlights brand. CDS Global is an extension of our brand by making that first experience memorable and pleasurable.</p>
                <p><strong>Renee:</strong> We&rsquo;ve always had a teamwork philosophy. I do not view our relationship as vendor/client. I view it as &ldquo;we are in this together, and in order to be successful, we have to work as a team. I work mostly with the Boone operations, and they make it easy to add new business ideas. I find that the team loves the chance to try something new.</p>
                <p><strong>Q: How is CDS Global driving revenue for your organization?</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Jeff:</strong> CDS Global has partnered with us to understand our products and what we are striving for. CDS Global then clearly communicates the value, features and benefits to our customers in a way that allows them to imagine the product as a useful benefit to share with their children, which in turns creates an opportunity to up-sell and cross-sell.</p>
                <p><strong>Renee:</strong> Something that we have been doing successfully for the last couple of years is aggressively cross-selling our magazines and books across all our magazine titles. This has turned into a nice little profit center that has become second nature to our customer service team. We have also been successful at saving subscriptions from cancellation. Subscribers who call to cancel are not the easiest people to persuade, but the customer service representatives find saving them a challenge and are not afraid to tackle it head-on.</p>
                <p><strong>Q: How does CDS Global provide outstanding customer service?</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Jeff:</strong> Over the years we have had several examples of customers raving about their customer service experience, from a representative simply providing a listening, empathetic ear to quick and efficient service to wanting to become a lifelong loyalist to our brand because the representative was caring and compassionate in resolving their specific problem.</p>
                <p><strong>Renee:</strong> I don&rsquo;t know if I can pinpoint just one thing. Over time, you build a team that has been trained on your businesses, and with time it becomes second nature and that culture is passed on. I believe CDS Global gives our customers more than what they expect to get.  Because of this we have consistently happy customers.</p>
                <p><strong>Q: How do you ensure that the CDS Global customer service representatives are connected with your products?</strong></p>
                <p>J<strong>eff:</strong> We spend time talking about our products with the leadership team and front-line workers. We visit the customer service teams and put the products in front of them, allowing them to touch the products, use them and understand first-hand what the user&rsquo;s experience might be like. We supply product fact sheets and contests around selling particular items as well.</p>
                <p><strong>Renee:</strong> When we revamped our cross-sells and up-sells, we did several training sessions that generated excitement. We also supplied samples of every item so representatives could become familiar with the products they would be offering. In order for these types of promotions to be successful, you have to invest the time to ensure that everyone is as passionate about it as you are. I&rsquo;m always available for any questions from our customer service staff; they are our eyes and ears and will see any trends first.</p>
                <p><strong>Q: What do you want every customer to take away from a contact with CDS Global&rsquo;s call centers?</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Jeff:</strong> I want them to be refreshed by an experience that meets their needs &ndash; an experience that says, &ldquo;I care about you as an individual; I care about your family and most importantly, your children. I want a service experience that sets our company apart from all others and also educates the customer about products that may help their children get a leg up in today&rsquo;s world.</p>
                <p><strong>Renee:</strong> This may sound like a broken record, but as cliché as it is, our expectation is for the customer to feel like they are talking directly to someone at Meredith. Every customer should walk away satisfied that their concern was taken seriously and handled professionally with the warm, Midwestern feel that we are known for.  </p>
