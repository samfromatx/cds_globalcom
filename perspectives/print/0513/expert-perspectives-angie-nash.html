                <p><strong>Q: Tell us about your role with CDS Global.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> I manage and forecast customer service staffing needs, which really means that I manage clients&rsquo; relationships with their subscribers. That includes doing everything from working with our front-line customer service representatives and making sure that they are knowledgeable about our clients&rsquo; businesses to actually giving direction to our clients about what their customers think they should do better or differently.</p>
                <p><strong>Q: Tell us about your background in customer service.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> I began with CDS Global as a production manager in Operations about 12 years ago. From there I moved into our call center and then to our data entry area. I then managed our training programs, and then went back to customer service. I&rsquo;ve spent time in our U.K. offices, helping them learn continuous process improvement concepts such as how to handle processes in the most efficient way and how to measure success, not just with customer service, but within their operations, too. I&rsquo;ve been able to bring some of their situations and solutions back to the U.S. for implementation also. Now that I have a good understanding of their workflow, I&rsquo;m able to collaborate with their management team on a weekly basis via conference calls to share ideas, progress and measurements. </p>
                <p><strong>Q: What have you noticed about the recent spike in tablet and digital readership, and how is CDS Global is providing customer service for all devices?</strong></p>
                <p><strong>A: </strong>With the explosion of tablets, smartphones and other reading devices, our clients have done a great job jumping into the trend and offering publications in each of those different formats. From a customer service standpoint, the calls are primarily people who are unable to download something, can&rsquo;t sign in to get a particular app or issue, or are having trouble accessing archives. When people start getting into places they&rsquo;re not familiar with, they get nervous, and that&rsquo;s when they call and ask &ldquo;Can you help me with this?&rdquo; Luckily, our customer service representatives are really good at assisting people with navigating various digital and mobile devices. CDS Global has done a great job of allowing us to buy devices like iPads and Kindle Fires so we can check out what our clients are doing with each. We&rsquo;re then able to train representatives to help customers without having the device in front of them. </p>
                <p>A lot of times, clients haven&rsquo;t necessarily known how they want to handle digital customer service or what&rsquo;s happening from a customer experience standpoint, and we&rsquo;ve been able to educate them on what their customers are seeing or experiencing when they go to order something online or via an app, iTunes, Amazon, etc.</p>
                <p>Digital customer service has definitely been a fun venture for us to get into. It all began when the first iPad came out, and everything has just sort of blown up from there. It&rsquo;s fun to be part of it, be able to get ourselves up to speed, know what customers are seeing and offer them advice. Nothing&rsquo;s better than when they hang up saying, &ldquo;Gosh, that was easy,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Wow, that helped.&rdquo;</p>
                <p><strong>Q: What interesting trends are you noticing with subscription models?</strong></p>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> People definitely want to have their subscriptions both ways. They like having the print to go home to, but they like having the digital to travel. People aren&rsquo;t necessarily giving up their print subscription to go digital; they&rsquo;re buying both. We thought we would see a decline on the print side, but that really hasn&rsquo;t been the case. </p>
                <p>When tablets first became popular, several publishers were offering digital content for free. But now, many of them are bundling the pricing. They recognize that there&rsquo;s value in digital content, and they shouldn&rsquo;t just give it away. So maybe they hook a reader by offering digital content for free to begin with, then they promote a bundled version to them later.</p>
                <p><strong>Q: What changes are you seeing with autorenewals?</strong></p>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> The concept of automatically being renewed or giving your credit card and having it charged on a timed basis has evolved culturally. Autorenewal used to be something that customers weren&rsquo;t as familiar with and were always very skeptical of. People used to think that autorenewal offers were a scam or that they were going to get charged to no end.</p>
                <p>But because things have changed, people aren&rsquo;t as skeptical &ndash; so many of us pay our bills automatically now. While there will always be people who don&rsquo;t like it, many customers ask to be put on autorenewal so they don&rsquo;t have to hassle with getting a bill.</p>
                <p><strong>Q: What trends have you noticed in up-selling?</strong></p>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> Up-selling is something we&rsquo;ve really embraced over the last several years. CDS Global&rsquo;s up-sell solution, Intellisel, was created more than 10 years ago, but our clients are seeing customer touchpoints as revenue opportunities more and more. Our customer service representatives have run full speed ahead with offering different up-sells to customers.</p>
                <p>There&rsquo;s definitely been a cultural shift. It used to be that people weren&rsquo;t as familiar with up-selling, so they were less willing to agree to offers. But now, because you see up-selling everywhere, whether it&rsquo;s a fast food place, a clothing store or the movie theater &ndash; &ldquo;Would you like a large popcorn for only 25 cents more?&rdquo; &ndash; people are more accepting of listening to the offer and oftentimes agreeing to it. </p>
                <p><strong>Q: What advice do you have for publishers who are looking to provide digital customer service?</strong></p>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> CDS Global clients should get in touch with their account teams as early in the process as possible. Implementing digital customer service can be handled several different ways, but some are obviously better than others, depending on a particular client&rsquo;s goals.</p>
                <p>Publishers should think about how their digital platforms work from an end-user perspective. Little things like calling sign-on credentials a username when you really want their email address can be confusing. Our account teams can provide a wealth of knowledge and advice.</p>
