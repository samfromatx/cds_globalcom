            	<h1>Message from Malcolm</h1>
                <p>Returning from London on the only flight that left for New York on the day of a recent large snowstorm, I had a lot of time to think about CDS Global as a global business. I had just met with an incredible team at Bauer U.K., discussing the digital landscape from a U.S. perspective, and in that process learned much about the U.K. and German perspectives.  </p>
                <p>In two weeks, I'll be working in Canada, exploring partnership opportunities with some great technology companies to support our nonprofit and solutions industry customers. There is great innovation and collaboration going on to the north of our U.S. Midwest corporate home.</p>
			  <p>And in a few months, I’ll go to Australia, as we are implementing new technology to our wonderful clients there. I’ll also be meeting with young companies who are developing incredible products and services.</p>
                <p>So the global in CDS Global is taking root. It is benefiting our clients wherever they do business. New ideas in Australia pop up in meetings in Chicago. Technology wizards in Canada support U.S. digital solutions.</p>
                <p>Now back to the long plane ride into the New York-area snowstorm. Waiting for the plane, I picked up a copy of <a href="http://www.economist.com/printedition/specialreports?year%5bvalue%5d%5byear%5d=2013&category=76984" target="_blank"><em>The Economist</em>’s Jan. 19-25</a> issue, and to my surprise, found it was a special issue on outsourcing. Close to my heart.</p>
                <p>In a nutshell, it told a <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21569572-after-decades-sending-work-across-world-companies-are-rethinking-their-offshoring" target="_blank">compelling story</a> about companies bringing back outsourced services to the country where their customers are. It spoke of the power of outsourcing in this age of specialization, but of the trend – and need – to use a provider who understands the culture, the customer and the service in a way that offshore providers just can't. I found out the new buzzword is “reshoring.”</p>
                <p>For CDS Global, this is not a new trend. We've been onshoring for 40 years, knowing that a local, dedicated staff in the countries we work in is key to our customers’ success. We have resisted the trend to find the cheapest labor. Instead, we've built the most efficient and dedicated labor force, delivering value – not just inexpensive service. We don't call it onshoring – whether it's Europe, Australia, Canada, or the U.S. We just call it doing great business. Who knew CDS Global would be trendy!</p>
