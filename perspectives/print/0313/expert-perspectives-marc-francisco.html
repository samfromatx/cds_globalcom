            	<p><img src="/perspectives/images/032013/5_lg.jpg" alt="Marc Francisco"></p>
                <p>Between relocating from Des Moines to New York City and being the first CDS&nbsp;Global employee to win Hearst Magazines&rsquo; prestigious Spotlight Award, Marc Francisco has had a productive two years. He recently sat down with Perspectives to provide his unique insights on the latest in digital subscriptions and customer service enhancements.</p>
                <p><strong>Q: Tell us about your career with CDS&nbsp;Global.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> I started in the call center during college, then worked my way into operations, and then product fulfillment. I became an account manager for the product fulfillment group, then moved into IT as a product manager for our customer service systems. When <a href="https://twitter.com/KristinRunyan" target="_blank">Kristin Runyan</a>, our chief product officer, arrived, I moved from IT to Product Management and became responsible for our eCommerce platforms. Now, I serve as an architectural product manager, which means I support the Product Management team in the design of new products.</p>
                <p><strong>Q: How did your career take you from Des Moines to New York? What have been some of the benefits?</strong></p>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> I came to New York for an extended stay to work on a client project and really enjoyed it. I offered to work on any other New York-based projects, and it eventually turned into a full-time position. I am very pleased to have had the opportunity to relocate. With most of our clients in New York, it has allowed me to work one-on-one with them to better understand how they use our products and what they want from them. We now get them on board from an early stage and involved in our overall strategy. It&rsquo;s really made a positive change in how we build products. </p>
                <p><strong>Q: Tell us about how you recently won the Hearst Spotlight Award.  </strong></p>
                <p><strong>A: </strong>This past December, I received a note from <a href="https://twitter.com/CareyAtHearst" target="_blank">David Carey</a>, president of Hearst Magazines, that I had won. It was an honor because it was the first year anyone from CDS&nbsp;Global was included in the awards. Fifty-two people from Hearst Magazines received the award out of more than 5,000 Hearst Magazines employees.</p>
                <p><strong>Q: What is your background in digital newsstands, and what changes have you recently seen in this arena?</strong></p>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> Prior to my current position, I worked on CDS&nbsp;Global&rsquo;s Web Service Gateway, which is frequently used to enable electronic consumption of magazines and content. Tablet owners are some of the biggest users, whether they go through the Apple iTunes Store or Google Play on an Android device. I focused on the different selling methods that involve authentication back to the data at CDS&nbsp;Global.</p>
                <p>When digital content first became popular, a lot of larger publishers started out with free access because they were getting pushback from readers when they charged extra. But now, we are starting to see a slow shift in how publishers are selling digital content and how consumers are reacting. There&rsquo;s less giving it away for free, but more offering digital content as a premium with a print subscription. </p>
                <p>And now, many of CDS&nbsp;Global&rsquo;s clients are indicating in their customer accounts that they have activated a subscription with a tablet or mobile device, so we can provide custom, targeted offers at renewal time. </p>
                <p><strong>Q: What advancements are you seeing in electronic customer service?</strong></p>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> At CDS&nbsp;Global, we&rsquo;re working on a new customer service platform, eCare, that allows a consumer to see all the purchases they&rsquo;ve made from a publisher regardless of the platform those purchases were made on. For example, if someone buys a book from a Web Store, a magazine subscription via U.S. mail and a digital subscription on a mobile device, they will no longer have to go to a customer care page for each product &ndash; they will be able to see everything on one screen. The first phase will be available in second quarter of this year, and phases will continue to roll out through the end of the year. </p>
                <p><strong>Q: What else is CDS&nbsp;Global doing to improve customer service?</strong></p>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> We are building a new system for our customer service representatives from scratch. We&rsquo;re using modern technology to build it and the same infrastructure as eCare so a customer service representative will see all of a customer&rsquo;s activity on one screen. Otherwise, if the customer doesn&rsquo;t mention they bought a book, the customer service rep might not know. From a client perspective, it increases operator efficiencies and improves up-sell and cross-sell opportunities because our reps have faster and easier access to data. We are also excited because it&rsquo;s going to be much easier to train representatives. The speed at which we&rsquo;ll be able to hire someone and have them be a productive team member will greatly increase.</p>
