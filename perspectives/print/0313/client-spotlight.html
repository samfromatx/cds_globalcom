            	<h1>iPad Customer Service and Beyond: CDS&nbsp;Global Helps <em>Scientific American</em> Launch New Ventures</h1>
            	<p><img src="/perspectives/images/032013/4_lg.jpg" alt="Scientific American"></p>
                <p>Media companies everywhere are keenly aware of the iPad&rsquo;s ever-growing presence in publishing. But while the iPad offers great potential, it also presents unique challenges. With more and more readers abandoning glossies for a glowing screen, publishers must not only offer tablet editions, but also provide quality customer service for these devices. </p>
                <p><em>Scientific American</em> offers an iPad edition as part of its premium subscription. More than just a digital version of the print issue, it provides readers with an entirely new, interactive reading experience. <em>Scientific American</em> knew it needed to provide iPad-specific customer service to ensure its valued customers maximize the tablet edition&rsquo;s benefits and can use the device without difficulty.</p>
                <p>With CDS&nbsp;Global already managing customer service for <em>Scientific American</em>&rsquo;s approximately 400,000 print subscribers, expanding the partnership to include the iPad seemed natural. <em>Scientific American</em> visited CDS&nbsp;Global&rsquo;s Des Moines location to conduct a full day of customer-service training.</p>
                <p>The training sessions proved a positive experience for CDS&nbsp;Global and <em>Scientific American</em> alike. &ldquo;From the beginning, it was clear that the people we were training were just as enthusiastic about the product as <em>Scientific American</em> and our customers. It was evident that CDS&nbsp;Global was really a good fit,&rdquo; says Michael Thomas, senior digital product manager for <em>Scientific American</em>.</p>
                <p>The CDS&nbsp;Global customer service representatives assigned to <em>Scientific American</em> now have expansive knowledge about how to use and troubleshoot the publication&rsquo;s tablet edition for iPad, and receive regularly updated guides and additional assistance from <em>Scientific American</em> when needed. Samantha Watson, senior account manager for CDS&nbsp;Global, cites strong communication between CDS&nbsp;Global and <em>Scientific American</em> as the key to making iPad customer service a success: &ldquo;There is an open line of communication where feedback from the customers reaches <em>Scientific American</em> quickly, and they respond and react to the needs of the customer to make the experience positive,&rdquo; she says.</p>
                <p><em>Scientific American</em> will soon launch its own Web store platform, and plans to work alongside CDS&nbsp;Global in this endeavor. Christian Dorbandt, managing director of consumer marketing at <em>Scientific American</em>, says, &ldquo;We believe in working with CDS&nbsp;Global to develop a small team of experts on <em>Scientific American</em> and the range of services and products that we offer â€“ those are the flagship people of our brand.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>As <em>Scientific American</em> continues to expand its digital offerings, they rest assured CDS&nbsp;Global is providing quality customer service that allows them to focus on their goals. &ldquo;We really think that our customers make all the difference. They are who we cater to, but our expertise is not customer support,&rdquo; Thomas says. &ldquo;Customer support is a real genuine business with a real set of skills you have to hire for, and CDS&nbsp;Global is a leader in that realm. When I come in to work, I&rsquo;m not going to have an inbox full of angry customers because CDS&nbsp;Global takes care of our customers. As a product owner, that makes me feel really good. I know that as we move forward and have brand evangelists working as a dedicated team for us, I&rsquo;m going to get a set of very confident, very enthusiastic people that are going to help us launch our Web store and help us grow into the future. We can&rsquo;t do that without a very strong partner whose focus is customer service.&rdquo;</p>
