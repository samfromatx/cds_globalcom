            	<h1>The Power and Value of Data: Q-and-A with Charlie Swift, Vice President of Marketing Analysis &amp; Operations at Hearst Magazines</h1>
            	<p><img src="/perspectives/images/032013/3_lg.jpg" alt="Charlie Swift"></p>
                <p><strong>Q: Tell us about your career path and background in data.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> I started in the management consulting space. I then went to American Express&rsquo; strategic planning group and got involved in helping them use information and data analysis as part of their overall strategy for things like membership rewards and incentive structures to stimulate people to change their behaviors in credit card spending. </p>
                <p>I advanced my career to the analytics front and eventually became head of the consumer card and business analysis groups at American Express. That was what really launched me into data and analysis as a career. From there, I always kept the idea of &ldquo;how do we understand customer data, how does data reflect the behavior and actions of customers, and how can we use that information to help understand the decisions we want to make as a business?&rdquo; at the forefront.</p>
                <p>My career has really been a translation between the true statisticians, model builders and IT people and the businesspeople who use their information to make decisions. Ultimately, it&rsquo;s all about &ldquo;How do I take information to knowledge, knowledge to action and action to modernization?&rdquo;</p>
                <p><strong>Q: What are some of the most important things publishers want to discern from their data?</strong></p>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> Fundamentally, everybody is really looking for two things. First and foremost, publishers are looking for people who are already enrolled in their products to try to understand who else may want their products so they can be more efficient in how they reach out to and engage them. If we&rsquo;re doing a direct mail or email program, we want to send the right offers to the right people so we can be as efficient as possible in bringing people to our magazines.</p>
                <p>The second piece is the new frontier. As we begin to evolve into the product sets we want to offer, we really don&rsquo;t have a history to look at. The traditional plan is to use data to understand the past to predict the future. But now we&rsquo;re going into uncharted territory where the past doesn&rsquo;t exist &ndash; we&rsquo;re going into a new world where data is really critical for us to understand what&rsquo;s going on and help us address the actions we take. Data helps us determine whether we are taking the right actions, and if not, how to course-correct as quickly as possible. So while data can&rsquo;t necessarily be predictive of where we should go, it can get us back on track. </p>
                <p><strong>Q: How is data impacting publishers&rsquo; decisions? </strong></p>
                <p><strong>A: </strong>Data is at the forefront of how we develop products. We get out in front of the products we want to launch by looking at data and asking, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the likelihood of success?&rdquo; As we begin to think about more and more new products, it&rsquo;s really critical that we have a greater understanding of who our loyal customers are and who we can reach out to, to get even more understanding of what will and won&rsquo;t be successful. </p>
                <p>In the past, we may have said, &ldquo;I have an idea and I want to push it.&rdquo; But now, we&rsquo;re doing a lot more testing of our ideas and adjusting our products quickly. As a result, we can bring better products to market faster because of our ability to understand what success is faster.</p>
                <p><strong>Q: We hear the term &ldquo;big data&rdquo; thrown around a lot. What does it mean to you and to Hearst?</strong></p>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> I think &ldquo;big data&rdquo; is just a recognition that we may have had limits before, but now technology is at a place that if we so desire, we can track, monitor and understand almost any behavior we want. Really, big data just means no one should be constrained by the idea of &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand&rdquo; anymore.</p>
                <p>The challenge, of course, is data overload. Just because you have a lot of data doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean it&rsquo;s informing you. What we need to do is make sure we&rsquo;re not caught in the sexy glitz of lots of data and remind ourselves of what&rsquo;s important. We need to ask, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the customer journey we&rsquo;re trying to take?&rdquo; and &ldquo;How can data be used to inform that journey?&rdquo; Big data has many blessings and many curses in that it provides a lot information that can provide you the right answer &ndash; and a lot of information that can provide you the wrong answer. You have to be a lot more thoughtful about using information and what it actually represents. </p>
                <p>I think big data in many ways is a term to help culturally transform everyone. When I first got to Hearst, I focused on showing people how data could be used to help make a decision. Now it&rsquo;s almost the expectation that data is there to help make every decision, and I have to instead make sure it&rsquo;s the right data. And sometimes I think it&rsquo;s not just about data, it&rsquo;s about intuition and creativity as we move into uncharted territory.</p>
                <p><strong>Q: Why is a solution like CDS Global&rsquo;s <a href="/perspectives/2013/march/prospect-insights.html">Prospect Insights</a> so important to publishers?</strong></p>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> CDS Global is in a unique position in the marketplace because it has a great understanding of a huge percentage of what&rsquo;s going on with the magazine readers of America. And to the extent that you can leverage that understanding and provide it back to clients through a prospect database, and do so in a way that&rsquo;s informative and efficient, it just makes everybody better. Ultimately, we all rise and think together as an industry in terms of succeeding in culturally keeping magazines current and at the forefront. And if the prospect database that CDS Global has built can help the smaller players that don&rsquo;t have the scale be successful as well, it&rsquo;s good for everybody. Magazine reading is not a me vs. you kind of industry; it&rsquo;s about getting people to read as much as they can. </p>
