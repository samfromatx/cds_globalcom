            	<h1>2012 CDS Global Summit Inspires, Educates</h1>
                <p>2012 marked a number of reasons for CDS Global to celebrate – 40 years in business, 30 years as part of the Hearst family and another year to gather with our clients to share best practices and industry leadership that contribute to our mutual success. </p>
                <p>As Chairman and CEO Malcolm Netburn penned in his opening letter to attendees of this year’s Summit, “The 2012 CDS Global Summit is the most important Summit we have ever held. With hard-hitting industry changes affecting all of us, CDS Global has been working laser-focused to develop the products and solutions you need to meet challenges head-on. Never before has the value of strategic partnering been more critical to success.” </p>
                <p>As a cornerstone of this partnership, CDS Global is dedicated to being a learning organization, always moving forward, peering to the distant horizon to proactively fulfill the needs of our clients. </p>
                <p>As we began this year’s Summit with an Opening Reception and 40th Anniversary Celebration at the Dr. Norman E. Borlaug World Food Prize Hall of Laureates, this foundational truth of our organization was ever-present. The building, a former public library that, for generations, served as a repository of knowledge for the Des Moines community, is a testament to the empowerment that comes from lifelong learning. </p>
                <p>And so, with this backdrop, CDS Global celebrated the power of knowledge that fosters innovation. We heard from speakers such as Ambassador Kenneth M. Quinn, president of the World Food Prize Foundation; David Carey, president of Hearst Magazines; Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad; and CDS Global founder Don Ross, who all spoke of the power innovation brings, whether that power is serving to feed the world, deliver mobile content, boost a state’s economy or start a company from the ashes of a magazine closure. Netburn prompted us all to be the very best, drawing strength from our core values as we, like a skilled fly fisherman, make the difficult look easy. </p>
                <p>And times are difficult. As we were reminded in the General Session opening tribute held on Sept. 11, the world is a difficult place. But, as Netburn reminded us, we must “dedicate ourselves to a better world.” At CDS Global, we believe that part of how we do that is by working with clients to better their businesses – by working hard, delivering leading solutions and being honest. </p>
                <p>We want our clients to be infected by the efforts our employees are taking, the type of effort that launched five products – Web Service Gateway, eHub, eEditions, Magento Web Stores and Electronic Bill Presentment and Payment (EBPP) – in two-and-a-half years. </p>
                <p>In turn, CDS Global is energized by the efforts our clients are making. We were amazed by the <a href="https://www.cds-global.com/media/pdf/August_Home.pdf" target="_blank">best practices</a> shared by August Home Publishing’s Don Peschke, who decided to “blow up” his business model, re-imagine content and develop a digital-first strategy. We were excited to learn the ways in which Steven Jacobs, Kat Knudson and John LeBrun are meeting challenges head-on, and appreciated their insights and transparency in our <a href="https://www.signup4.net/Upload/CDSG10A/CDSG12E/Client_Panel.pdf" target="_blank">Client Panel</a>. Whether related to mail-saving polybags, embedded sub forms or digital marketing strategy, their insights were invaluable to fellow attendees – and a testament to how the publishing industry is working together for future success. And, we added another level of engagement through important conversations during the Birds of a Feather Breakfast Sessions. As David Carey reminded us during the General Session with an African proverb, “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.” </p>
                <p>This spirit of open communication and direct sharing was just as present among our nonprofit clients, who took the opportunity to engage with Brian Reich of little m media and CDS Global’s Brett Ridge, our senior solutions manager for nonprofit strategies, in a discussion ranging from trapped data to subscription-based economies. </p>
                <p>Whether through the Nonprofit Roundtable or General Session, we were also reminded that we must not only look to ourselves, or our own industries, for answers. Anthony Paustian, provost of DMACC West, helped us see in his <a href="https://www.signup4.net/Upload/CDSG10A/CDSG12E/Paustian_Presentation.pdf" target="_blank">Innovator’s Forum talk</a> that even educational institutions must think constantly about how best to innovate and grow. Innovation is everywhere – and we must all leave no stone unturned as we seek to foster it in our own organizations. We must, in the words of Brian Solis, end business as usual,  and as Chris Wilkes stressed in his <a href="https://www.signup4.net/Upload/CDSG10A/CDSG11E/Wilkes.pdf" target="_blank">presentation</a>, “be great enablers.” </p>
                <p>CDS Global is committed to being that great enabler, allowing clients to engage with their audiences on a deeper level with multiple channels. We’re dedicated to continuing the conversation day-in and day-out, and are looking forward to our 2013 CDS Global Summit where we can once again gather together to collaborate on a larger scale. Plans are already in the works for next year, so stay tuned! </p>
