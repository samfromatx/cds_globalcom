                <p>CDS Global completes its 40th year, and we are already working on the next 40. That's what you would expect from us and that is exactly what we are doing. We've enjoyed the yearlong celebration, and we hope you did as well at our Summit and special anniversary event in September.</p>
                <p>It has given us an opportunity to honor our clients for the privilege of trusting us with your customers, contributors and members. We work hard to earn your trust every day, helping to accomplish your goals. You are why we exist and what we live for.</p>
                <p>We have been able to honor our 2,400 employees around the globe. They are CDS Global. And it was very special to recognize the three employees who celebrated 40 years with the company. Their loyalty, commitment and dedication are models to so many of us.</p>
                <p>In this era of 24-hour, seven-day-a-week immediate and instant communication, it allowed us to pause – if just for a brief moment – and also honor and thank our partners, suppliers and local communities that we live in. </p>
                <p>It gave us a chance to say thank you to our parent company, Hearst Corporation, for the support in making us one of the great business process outsourcers (BPOs) in the countries we work in. We thank Mark Miller for acquiring CDS Global and stewarding it for so many years, and to John Loughlin for his vision and intelligence, keeping us strong in these past economically difficult times. And we are honored to have the support and enthusiasm of David Carey, our division president, who pushes us to places we have hardly dreamed of.</p>
                <p>And now to the future. CDS Global has committed to you to be a technology-driven company – global, innovative, proactive and delivering best-of-class service. We do not believe in resting on our laurels. Today's laurels are tomorrow’s downfall. That is why you will hear so much from us this coming year about reinvention. Creating more efficient processes, driving eCommerce and digital solutions, suggesting to our clients new ways of doing business. In short, becoming a solution provider. And the very best solution provider.</p>
              <p>Engraved on the National Archives building in Washington, D.C., is the phrase, "What is past is prologue." As we look at our past, and what we are doing to strengthen our company today, we are confident of a future even brighter than our last 40 years. Thank you for joining us on this journey. Let us build great things together.</p>
