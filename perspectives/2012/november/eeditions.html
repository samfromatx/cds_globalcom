                <h2><span style="text-transform:lowercase">e</span>Editions: Managing Digital Sales Data</h2>
                <p>CDS Global recently launched eEditions, the media industry’s first digital newsstand data management solution. For publishers, this innovative solution greatly reduces the burden of aggregating and organizing digital newsstand sales data into manageable, easy-to-analyze reports. </p>
                <h2>The Importance of Business Intelligence Metrics from Digital Sales</h2>
                <p>In CDS Global’s <a href="http://www.cds-global.com/forms/whitepapers/report_monetizing_the_digital_revolution_second_edition.html" target="_blank">recent research</a> conducted with Red 7 Media, we found that digital sales comprise 14 percent of total gross revenue for consumer media companies and 20 percent in the business-to-business sector. However, that number is expected to grow significantly – consumer and business-to-business publications alike estimate that digital will provide 40 percent or more of their total revenue in five years. As digital marketplaces become an important source of income for publishers, they must leverage sales data from these new platforms to ascertain a clearer picture of customers’ buying habits. </p>
                <p>"Magazine publishers are desperate to find the magic formula for taking advantage of the explosion in tablet use," says Allen Weiner, research vice president at Gartner, Inc. specializing in media services. "As a growing number of digital newsstands begin to provide more customer data to publishers, magazines must identify tools that will solidify their revenue models across the different digital content formats that currently exist. Publishers who can marry aggregated sales data to product information will be on the road to meaningful intelligence that will have a real impact on the bottom line."</p>
                <h2>The Problems with Disparate Data</h2>
                <p>Preparing to capitalize on the surge in digital sales is easier said than done. Digital magazine sales come with several challenges, namely differing terminology, difficulties with consolidation and the large size of data files. The ever-expanding industry lacks a traditional publication-marketing focus for data management and reporting of digital newsstand data. </p>
                <p>Disparate data leaves publishers with yet another challenge – how do they deal with the sheer volume of data?  Do they pull employees away from projects that generate revenue to make sense of the data, or do they use funds to hire additional manpower to do this?</p>
                <p>As third parties such as Amazon, Apple, Barnes & Noble, Google and Zinio sell content, media companies lose control of valuable sales data. Inconsistent data fields and file types create a particularly difficult problem for publishers wanting to dissect their own data. Terms such as annual subscriptions and renewals are often worded differently and placed in incongruent columns, and vendors provide files in various formats such as CSV, Excel, HTML and text. As a result, media companies spend countless hours manipulating data to create a consistent format.</p>
                <p>While all of the information each spreadsheet contains is incredibly valuable, publishers often lack the infrastructure to examine it effectively. Digital newsstand sales data files can be too large to open on a standard PC. Each document contains information about potentially millions of customers, so opening files from multiple vendors – let alone one – is enough to send most computers into overdrive.</p>
                <h2>The Industry’s First Solution for Digital Data Management</h2>
                <p>CDS Global’s eEditions solution manages detailed digital storefront sales data along with an overlay of reporting to manage rate base, financial recognition and reconciliation. eEditions offers numerous reporting types:</p>
                <ul>
                	<li>Sales – activity measured by issue and orders</li>
                    <li>Retention – subscription retention by issue</li>
                    <li>Circulation audit – issues served with optional date range</li>
                    <li>Dashboards – consolidated view of sales metrics</li>
                    <li>Support – data update statistics</li>
                </ul>
                <p>eEditions also has the ability to sort sale types by offer (e.g., single issues, subscriptions and special interest publications), standardize terms across vendors, link sales and renewal activity by customer and retention trending reports, and store aggregate sales and customer data for reporting.</p>
                <p>CDS Global’s business intelligence environment provides users with a single location to access reports, which are grouped under logical tabs in an optimized interface that simplifies the user experience. eEditions offers multiple reporting output methods, including HTML and PDF.</p>
                <p>The solution is currently integrated with four of the industry’s top newsstands: </p>
                <ul>
                	<li>Apple</li>
                    <li>Amazon</li>
                    <li>Barnes &amp; Noble</li>
                    <li>Zinio</li>
                </ul>
                <p>As new data and reporting capabilities become available and new digital newsstands come online, CDS Global will continue to add functionality to the solution. </p>
                <p>Several publishers, including Hearst Magazines, are either using eEditions or in the onboarding process, while many others have expressed strong interest in the solution. Chris Wilkes, vice president of digital editions, magazines and apps at Hearst Magazines, recently stated, "Many media companies are wrestling with the management of digital consumer data and reporting. I’m pleased to see that CDS Global has resolved this challenge with their eEditions solution and am confident of the positive impact this will have on the industry." </p>
