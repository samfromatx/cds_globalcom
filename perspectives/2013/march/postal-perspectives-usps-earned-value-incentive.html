            	<h1>Postal Perspectives &ndash; USPS Earned Value Incentive Program &amp; 2012 Mail Volumes Infographic</h1>
            	<p>On April 1, 2013, the USPS&rsquo; Earned Value Incentive Program will take effect in an effort to encourage higher mail volumes. The program gives a 2-cent credit to the mailer of outbound First-Class Mail Business Reply Mail and Courtesy Reply Mail enclosure mail pieces with an Intelligent Mail barcode (IMb) that receive a reply using a qualified return envelope. When the inbound piece is sent back, the IMb is scanned and tracked through the USPS&rsquo; Intelligent Mail Visibility system and their Alternate Postage system. </p>
                <p>For example, a publisher mails a subscription offer with an IMb. The recipient accepts the offer and mails it back using the IMb-encoded envelope. When the envelope containing the accepted offer is scanned en route to CDS&nbsp;Global, the publisher&rsquo;s account receives a 2-cent credit.</p>
                <p>To take advantage of the program, mailers must register by March 31, 2013. The program runs from April 1 to June 30, 2013. At the end of the promotion, CDS&nbsp;Global will verify the counts and amount credited for accuracy. The mailer will then receive a credit toward a future mailing of Standard Mail letters through CDS&nbsp;Global.</p>
                <p>CDS&nbsp;Global is available to facilitate the program for our clients. Those interested should contact their account director, who will complete the appropriate paperwork on their behalf. Please consult your account director or the Earned Value Incentive Program <a href="https://ribbs.usps.gov/mobilebarcode/documents/tech_guides/current/EarnedValueReplyMailIncentiveProgramGuide.pdf" target="_blank">user guide</a> for more information.</p>
