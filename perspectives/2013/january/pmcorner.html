                <h2><strong>Available Now:</strong></h2>
                <p><strong>Enhancements  Made to Web Service Gateway for Demographic History Data </strong><strong>– </strong>An enhancement to the Web Service Gateway and the SERV Order  Management System allows you to make API calls to retrieve not only current  demographic data, but also historical information so you can see the evolution  of your customers&rsquo; activity with a single inquiry. </p>
              <p> <strong>Trigger  Marketing Solution Simplifies Promotions – </strong>CDS Global&rsquo;s  Trigger Marketing solution allows you to set up a campaign that promotes offers  of other relevant titles in your brand to your most recent subscribers. Hearst  Magazines recently implemented this solution and has seen a 10-11 percent average  response rate, compared to the typical 2-3.4 percent found in traditional  direct mail campaigns. <strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Engage  e-Promos Provides Targeted and Segmented Email Audiences – </strong>This  product is available for your promotional email marketing campaigns, providing  you the ability to reach your current and potential customers. e-Promos allows  you to target and segment your prospects and customers, so you can fine-tune  your messages based on a target audience to help you drive sales and retention.  Our e-Promos solution is flexible – you can use CDS Global resources for  design, testing and deployment with data pulled from the fulfillment system, or  you can use internal resources and/or a third-party mailing list.</p>
              <p><strong>Cross-Media  Communications Monetizes Cover Artwork –</strong> One of the many ways that  you can take advantage of our custom digital printing solution is to repurpose  your cover artwork. Cross-Media Communications can produce high-quality posters  of your covers that can be purchased through an existing Web store or a  simple-to-create storefront.</p>
              <p><strong>Electronic  Bill Presentment and Payment Enhancements Make Payments Easier</strong></p>
                <ul style="line-height: 1.5em;padding-bottom: 1em;">
                  <li><strong>Flexible  Payments Scheduling: </strong>Allows your end users the ability to  schedule and edit a range of payments any day of the week and make a payment at  any interval, for any amount, when it is convenient for them.<strong></strong></li>
                  <li><strong>Flexible  Recurring Payments: </strong>Enables your customers to set up recurring  payments for a fixed or billed amount at any frequency or interval they choose.  Customers may also choose an end date. These payments can be scheduled seven  days a week. </li>
                  <li><strong>Mobile  Web: </strong>Provides the option to have bill presentment available  on your mobile Web pages, in addition to the already-available bill payments. You  can send your customers a text and/or email that lets them know their bill is available.<strong> </strong></li>
              </ul>
                <h2><strong>Coming  Soon:</strong></h2>
                <p><em>To  find out exactly when these enhancements will be available, please check our  continuously updated Product Roadmaps, which also contain information  about all of our new solutions.</em></p>
                <p><strong>Circulation  Model Enhancements Will Provide More Robust Modeling Capabilities</strong><br>
                Upcoming Circulation Modeling enhancements include:</p>
                <ul style="line-height: 1.5em;">
                  <li>New area for credit card and cash cancel  rates and their corresponding distribution patterns will provide you with increased  modeling capabilities that are vital to your auto-renewals and ever-increasing  digital circulation. </li>
                  <li>When you incorporate the historical data  from the InFOCUS Circ+ R720-000 – or the Cash/Credit Card Cancel Timing Flow  report – into the new CDS Global Model section, the resulting output will  reflect a calculation of your cash/credit card cancels and rejects, providing  you with a more definitive budget and forecast.</li>
                  <li>A new MARS report, M305 – or the Credit  Card/Cash Subscription Cancellation Analysis – will provide you with detailed  descriptions of the new CDS Global Model calculations. </li>
                  <li>The ability to include Arrears/Special Arrears,  Adjustments/Extensions as well as other copies from the InFOCUS Circ+ H237-T00  – or the Earned Income by Model Source Report data – will be included in the  Closed Issue Balancing Report. This report provides you with a more  comprehensive view of your Model calculations in comparison to your closed  issues.</li>
              </ul>
                <p><strong>Prospect  Database Will Target Potential Customers</strong><br>
                  CDS Global&rsquo;s Prospect Database will profile your  existing clients, then find targeted prospects bearing the same attributes. Generic  prospect data, profile-driven data and scored prospect data will be available. Our  scored data will be generated by developing predictive models from your  customer data and then applying those results to find our lists, resulting in a  more targeted campaign and higher response rates.</p>
