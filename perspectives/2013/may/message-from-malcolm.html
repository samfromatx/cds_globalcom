                <a name="content"></a>
                <p>The lifecycle of an idea in this digital age moves at breathtaking speed. It seems just like yesterday when all of us focused on creating, building and delivering great products and services. It could be the great blood delivery service of the American Red Cross. Or a great book from Reader's Digest. Or a useful website from <em>Forbes Magazine</em>. </p>
                <p>And then in a nanosecond, the language and focus changed. We moved from product focus to brand focus. We started talking about great brands and how to nurture them. The brand value of the National Wildlife Federation as a leader in the environmental movement. The trust we have in donating to the American Heart Association. The powerful brand value of <em>Cook's Illustrated</em>, focusing on smart cooking. We all started working hard on our brand, understanding that our products and services need to enhance, to reinforce brand value.</p>
                <p>What's shorter than a nanosecond? Because as quick as light travels, our journey is now leading us past products, past services, past brands &ndash; to customers. Something we knew all along but lost sight of in our drive for great products and great brands. The obvious hidden by our obsessive desire to build great things and to create and nurture great brands.</p>
                <p>The customer, the donor, the supporter, the subscriber, the paying person &ndash; that's why we exist. They are the only reason we build great products and new services. They are why we invest in creating great brands. Understanding what our customer or consumer needs, what is of value to them &ndash; not us, not to our brand &ndash; that is the center all our work truly revolves around. </p>
                <p>In this respect, CDS Global's work is no different from you, our customers. We also love our products; we have worked for more than 40 years building our brand. But we have learned the lessons of this digital age and will stay obsessionally focused on our customers. Understanding your needs, your future. </p>
                <p>Everything in this era is changing. Products become obsolete quickly. Brand values of yesterday lose their luster in the light of disruption. But keeping the customer as the only thing that matters is a constant that will always drive success. Let's work on that together.</p>
