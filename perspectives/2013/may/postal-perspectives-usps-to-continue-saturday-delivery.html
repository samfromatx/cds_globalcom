            	<h1>Postal Service to Continue Saturday Delivery</h1>
            	<p>On April 10, 2013, the United States Postal Service (USPS) announced that it has delayed implementation of a proposed delivery schedule that would eliminate residential mail delivery on Saturdays.</p>
                <p>In February, the Postal Service unveiled a plan that would limit home mail delivery to packages on Saturdays beginning in August 2013. Under the plan, Post Offices were to remain open and mail addressed to P.O. Boxes would be available for pickup. The USPS expected that the elimination of Saturday delivery would reduce annual operating costs by $2 billion.</p>
                <p>However, in late March, Congress enacted a spending bill that required the Postal Service to continue six-day mail delivery. The Postal Service Board of Governors met on April 9 to discuss the congressional action and from that meeting instructed the Postal Service to delay the move to five-day mail delivery. The Board also asked that USPS management evaluate options to increase revenue, including a postage rate increase to raise revenues across current Postal Service products not currently covering their attributed costs, such as periodicals and Standard Mail Flats (catalogs). </p>
                <p>We will continue to report additional information as it becomes available.</p>
