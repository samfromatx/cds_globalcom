Network content sharing by multiposting between blogs for PHP v5.4+. Posts can be linked to each other and updated automatically.

== Description ==

Network content sharing by multiposting between blogs for PHP v5.4+. Broadcast can be used to copy posts to other blogs, link posts between blogs, share content as templates, etc. Broadcastable features include:

* Parent post links to child posts
* Posts, pages
* Taxonomies (categories, tags, etc)
* Custom fields
* Attached images
* Featured images
* Galleries

Broadcasted posts can be linked to their parents, which updates child posts when the parent post is updated. This includes all data: title, slug, content, custom fields, attachments, etc.

= SEO support =

* Permalinks of child posts (also see Permalinks plugin in the Premium Pack)
* Canonical URLs of child posts.

For those who have Yoast's Wordpress SEO plugin installed, if the Broadcast's canonical URL is selected (which will point to the parent post), it will simultaneously disable Yoast's canonical link. This will prevent search engine penalties.

= Other features =

* Groups plugin enables blog grouping for easy selection
* Custom field blacklist, whitelist and protect list.
* Last used settings are remembered
* User role access granularity
* An enormous amount of extra features in the premium pack

= Premium Pack =

The <a href="http://plugins.plainview.se/threewp-broadcast-premium-pack/" title="Premium Pack's page on the web"><em>Broadcast Premium Pack</em></a> is an actively maintained collection of plugins that expand the functionality of Broadcast.

* <strong>Sync Taxomnomies</strong> synchronize the taxonomies of target blogs with those from a source blog.
* <strong>User & Blog Settings</strong> (UBS) can hide the broadcast meta box and/or menu, modify the meta box to force/prevent broadcast to blogs, with separate settings for users / blogs / roles.

* <strong>WooCommerce</strong> allows attribute taxonomies and product variations to be broadcasted.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I need support! =

The easiest way to get my attention is to <a href="mailto:plugins@plainview.se">contact me via e-mail</a> and ask how to donate a little something for my time.

For contract work such as the following, contact me so we can make a deal:

* Broadcast is missing a feature you need
* Broadcast isn't properly interacting with other plugins
* Broadcast doesn't work on your custom site

If you're not into donations, try the support forum to see if other users can help you out.

= Debug dumps =

A debug dump is the long text that is displayed when broadcasting a post with debug mode on. This dump can then be read to see what Broadcast is or isn't doing.

To switch on debug mode, see the admin settings. If your site is live it would be wise to input your IP in the associated textarea, so that only you see the debug dump.

= Blacklist, whitelisting, force broadcast =

Broadcasting to specific blogs, hiding blogs and forcing blogs can be acheived with the <em>User & Blog Settings</em> plugin in the <a href="http://plugins.plainview.se/threewp-broadcast-premium-pack/" title="Premium Pack's page on the web"><em>Broadcast Premium Pack</em></a>.

= Bulk broadcast existing pages =

To broadcast many posts at once, see the <em>Send To Many</em> plugin in the <a href="http://plugins.plainview.se/threewp-broadcast-premium-pack/" title="Premium Pack's page on the web"><em>Broadcast Premium Pack</em></a>.

= Galleries and attachments =

Attachments are force-broadcasted: the child posts have all their attachments deleted and then copied again.

If you have a gallery shortcode in the post ( [gallery columns="2" ids="427,433,430,429,428"] ) then Broadcast will first check that the image does not already exist on the child blog. It does this by searching for the post name (the filename minus the extension). If no image is found, it is copied.

= Hide broadcast from the users =

The broadcast meta box, menu and columns in the post view can be hidden from users / roles / blogs using <em>User & Blog Settings</em> plugin in the <a href="http://plugins.plainview.se/threewp-broadcast-premium-pack/" title="Premium Pack's page on the web"><em>Broadcast Premium Pack</em></a>.

= Is php v5.4 really necessary? =

Yes. PHP v5.3 has been officially unsupported since the 14th of August, 2014. If your web host refuses to upgrade to a supported version, go find a new host.

= Orphans? =

If you have already created posts on other blogs that are supposed to be children of a specific post, you can use the "find orphans" function to find and link them.

Find the post in the post overview and use the row action "find orphans". You will then be presented with a table of possible orphans on each blog. Select the blog and then choose "link orphans" to create the links.

To be considered an orphan the orphaned posts must have the exact same title (name) as the soon-to-be parent.

= Why can I not see the Broadcast meta box? =

Make sure that:

1. The plugin is network enabled
2. Your user level has broadcast access (Broadcast access role)
3. Your user has write access to more than this blog (see Admin settings > Maintenenace > View blog access). Or use the All Blogs premium plugin to access all blogs.
4. The correct post type(s) have been selected
5. <em>User & Blog Settings</em> is not set to hide the meta box from the user / role / blog

= Why are the custom post type custom fields (or ACF data) not being broadcasted? =

If you've created a custom post type, but cannot see the "custom fields" checkbox, check your custom post type settings.

= WooCommerce =

Broadcast is capable of handling WooCommerce products.

1. In the custom post type settings: Add "product"
2. In the settings: select broadcast internal custom fields.
3. When broadcasting, select custom fields and taxonomies.

This will broadcast all normal product settings: SKU, price, etc.

If your products have variations, or you want the attribute taxonomies to be synced, you'll be wanting the WooCommerce plugin from the premium pack.

If you have a product gallery, use the "Custom Field Attachments" premium plugin to broadcast the "_product_image_gallery" custom field.

= WPML Sitepress =

WPML is semi-supported via a plugin in the premium pack.

For more information, see WPML discussion here: http://wordpress.org/support/topic/wmpl-integration-not-working

= XCache vs APC opcode cache =

Xcache v2 does not support PHP namespaces, which is a PHP 5.3 feature. Trying to enable Broadcast with Xcache v2 enabled will result in a PHP crash.

Xcache v3, which does support namespaces, has not yet been tested. Anyone with Xcache v3 experience is welcome to contact me with info.

APC works flawlessly.
