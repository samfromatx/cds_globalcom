The list below specifies for which post types and associated taxonomies the broadcasting user should be allowed to select taxonomies. On each line the first word must be the name of the post type slug, space, and then a list of space-separated taxonomies.

The default is:

<code>post category
* cities people</code>

The above example means that the category for posts will be controllable, together with all taxonomies called "cities" and "people" for all post types.
