The <em>Send To Many</em> function appears as a button above the post list.

Usage instructions:

<ul>
	<li>Find the posts you want to broadcast</li>
	<li>Check the box of each post</li>
	<li>Press the <em>Send To Many</em> button. A meta box should appear above the post list.</li>
	<li>Modify the broadcast settings.</li>
	<li>Select which blogs you want the post broadcasted to.</li>
	<li>Press the <em>Send To Many</em> button and wait.</li>
</ul>

Depending on how much data is to be broadcasted it could take up to 30 seconds to broadcast the posts to the blogs.

If you have the Queue plugin active the page will immediately refresh and you can watch the broadcast progress for each post.
